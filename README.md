<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of my_studies_regression_models is to simulate some regression
analysis using linear, segmented, polynomial and spline.

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

In that case, donâ€™t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub.
